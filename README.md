# Notes-V.II
# Web Application - React

This web application is a submission for the **Belajar Fundamental Aplikasi Web dengan React** course on Dicoding. The goal of this project is to build a web application that applies the concepts learned during the course, including property validation, client routing, component lifecycle, context, and hooks.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
- **PropTypes**: For property validation of components.
- **React Router**: For implementing client-side routing.
- **React Context**: For managing global state without prop drilling.
- **React Hooks**: For writing functional components in a more efficient way.

## Features

- Property validation using **PropTypes**.
- Client-side routing using **React Router**.
- Component lifecycle management for asynchronous tasks like fetching data from an API.
- Global state management using **React Context**.
- Efficient component structure using **React Hooks**.

## Learning Material Breakdown

- **Property Validation**: Learn how to validate component props using PropTypes (2 Hours 25 Minutes).
- **React Router**: Learn how to implement easy client-side routing using the React Router ecosystem (4 Hours 25 Minutes).
- **Component Lifecycle**: Learn how to use lifecycle methods to manage asynchronous processes like fetching data from APIs within components (5 Hours 5 Minutes).
- **React Context**: Learn how to manage global state without prop drilling using React Context (2 Hours 5 Minutes).
- **React Hooks**: Learn how to write cleaner and more efficient React code by maximizing the use of functional components with hooks (4 Hours 25 Minutes).
